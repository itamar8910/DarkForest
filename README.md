## Build prerequisites

### On Debian
```bash
apt-get install gcc g++ make curl libmpc-dev nasm qemu-system-i386 dosfstools
```

### On Windows
Firstly get the scoop package manager which can be found on Github, or manually install the following packages
```batch
scoop install nasm qemu msys2 
```

Then run msys2 and update pacman, then
```bash
pacman -S gcc make texinfo mpc-devel diffutils python3 dosfstools
```
If you used scoop in the first step you should also add the scoop shims to your path so you can access your scoop packages from msys2 bash

## Build toolchain
```bash
cd toolchain
./build.sh full
```

## Build DarkForest
```bash
export LOCATION_OF_DARKFOREST_REPO=$HOME/DarkForest # change this to where you have placed the repo
export PATH="$LOCATION_OF_DARKFOREST_REPO/toolchain/cross/bin:$PATH"

make
```

## Setup filesystem
```bash
fs_scripts/fs_setup.sh # needs root/administrator priv to mount fs
```

## Run
```bash
./run.sh
```


I take a lot of inspiration from Andreas Kling's amazing [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) - check it out!
